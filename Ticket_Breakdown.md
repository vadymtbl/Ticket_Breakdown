# Ticket Breakdown
We are a staffing company whose primary purpose is to book Agents at Shifts posted by Facilities on our platform. We're working on a new feature which will generate reports for our client Facilities containing info on how many hours each Agent worked in a given quarter by summing up every Shift they worked. Currently, this is how the process works:

- Data is saved in the database in the Facilities, Agents, and Shifts tables
- A function `getShiftsByFacility` is called with the Facility's id, returning all Shifts worked that quarter, including some metadata about the Agent assigned to each
- A function `generateReport` is then called with the list of Shifts. It converts them into a PDF which can be submitted by the Facility for compliance.

## You've been asked to work on a ticket. It reads:

**Currently, the id of each Agent on the reports we generate is their internal database id. We'd like to add the ability for Facilities to save their own custom ids for each Agent they work with and use that id when generating reports for them.**


Based on the information given, break this ticket down into 2-5 individual tickets to perform. Provide as much detail for each ticket as you can, including acceptance criteria, time/effort estimates, and implementation details. Feel free to make informed guesses about any unknown details - you can't guess "wrong".


You will be graded on the level of detail in each ticket, the clarity of the execution plan within and between tickets, and the intelligibility of your language. You don't need to be a native English speaker, but please proof-read your work.

**Ticket 1: Create a custom ID field for Agents**

**Description:** We need to add a new field to the Agents table in the database that will allow Facilities to save their own custom IDs for each Agent they work with. This field needs to be added to the table, and the API and front-end forms/screens need to be updated to accommodate this change.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- A new field labeled "Custom ID" is added to the Agents table in the database
- A new field labeled "Custom ID" is added to the front-end screens/forms where Agents are managed
- The API endpoint used to update an Agent now includes an optional "Custom ID" parameter
- The report generation function is updated to use the Custom ID if it exists, or fallback to the internal database ID if not

**Time/Effort Estimate:** 4 hours

**Implementation Details:**

- Add `custom_id` column to Agents table in the database using migration scripts
- Update API endpoint that handles updating Agents with code to handle the new "Custom ID" parameter
- Update front-end screens/forms to include the new "Custom ID" field
- Modify the report generation function to look up Custom ID when generating reports


**Ticket 2: Allow Facilities to set Custom IDs for Agents**

**Description:** We need to build out functionality to allow Facilities to set Custom IDs for Agents they are working with. This includes updating the front-end UI to allow Facilities to enter Custom IDs, as well as updating the API to accept them when updating the Agent record.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Front-end UI screens/forms for managing Agents include a new "Custom ID" field
- When adding/editing an Agent, Facilities are able to enter a Custom ID which will be saved to the database and displayed on reports
- Custom IDs are stored alongside the internal database IDs in the database
- Reports generated by the system use the Custom ID if it exists, or fallback to the internal database ID if not

**Time/Effort Estimate:** 8 hours

**Implementation Details:**

- Add a new field for "Custom ID" to the front-end UI screens/forms for managing Agents
- Modify the API endpoint that handles updating Agents to allow Facilities to include the Custom ID when editing an Agent record


**Ticket 3: Update report generation function to include Custom IDs**

**Description:** We need to update the report generation function to use the Custom ID instead of the internal database ID when generating reports, if it is available. 

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The report generation function is updated to check for and use the Custom ID when generating reports
- Reports now include the Custom ID instead of the internal database ID when generating reports for Facilities

**Time/Effort Estimate:** 6 hours

**Implementation Details:**

- Modify the report generation function to look up the Custom ID first, and fallback to the internal database ID if no Custom ID is available
- Regenerate all existing reports using the updated report generation function


**Ticket 4: Update user documentation regarding Custom IDs**

**Description:** We need to update our user documentation to include information about the recently added Custom ID functionality. This includes instructions on how to set and manage Custom IDs, as well as any other relevant details.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- User documentation has been updated with clear instructions on how to set and manage Custom IDs
- Documentation is easily accessible to Facilities through our platform's help center or other appropriate channels

**Time/Effort Estimate:** 2 hours

**Implementation Details:**

- Update relevant sections of the user documentation with instructions on how to use and manage Custom IDs
- Publish updates to the appropriate channels (e.g. help center, FAQ, etc.)
